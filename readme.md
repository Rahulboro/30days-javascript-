# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to my 30 Days JavaScript Challenge! This challenge is designed to improve my JavaScript skills by building a series of projects over 30 days. Each day, I will tackle a new task, gradually increasing in complexity. By the end of the challenge, I'll have a solid understanding of JavaScript and a portfolio of projects to showcase my skills.
